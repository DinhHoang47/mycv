## 1.Introduce

My name is Tran Dinh Hoang.

I graduated from Ho Chi Minh University of Technology with a degree in Mechanical Engineering. I discovered my interest in software development while working with Excel VBA. After returning to Vietnam, I transitioned into the IT field and am now aiming to become a successful System Engineer.

I currently live in District 9, Ho Chi Minh City.

In addition to my main job at a software company, I developed a web application to enhance my knowledge of software development and to help others learn Japanese vocabulary. Although it is still in development and has limited features, it already includes essential functions such as user login, the ability to create personal vocabulary lists, and tools for learning and tracking progress.Feel free to check it out at: nihongo.click.
